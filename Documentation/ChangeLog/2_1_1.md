## 2.1.1/1.1.1 Technical Update I

1. Moved read settings file from constructor to get instance and then read.
   > Gives more control on when settings is being read. Helps to prevent reading
   > settings when getting the only instance of Constants.
2. When an error is thrown, the terminal closed, not giving the user time to see the error.
   > User can now see the error. Before, the terminal would close and the user will not
   > know it was closing instead of running. Now the user has to press enter to exit the
   > Application.
3. Added custom error messages for Constants's exceptions
   > The Constants class had catch clauses reported as normal. I added custom
   > error messages to be able to identify and pinpoint the error and its
   > location.
